# GoConcoche
The GoConCoche project proposes the development of an intelligent backend system for car
sharing, designed to simulate real-world mobility services. The
system will enable users to search for, book, and manage car-sharing reservations at specific
locations; allow car owners to manage their rental offers; and provide administrators with tools to
oversee vehicle fleets and booking rules. It will also include advanced features such as secure
authentication using JWT. The project will be implemented using Java 21, Maven, and MySQL,
with a strong focus on modularity, security, and eﬃciency.
